# Robotics_Task
This ROS 2 package captures images from a USB camera, allowing users to toggle between grayscale and color modes via a service. It uses the usb_cam package for image capture and OpenCV for grayscale conversion. Processed images are published to a ROS 2 topic for further use, enabling real-time image mode switching.
